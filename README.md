# QuantumAlgosLearning

This repository is where I am documenting my implementations of various standard quantum algorithms. Relevant details will be noted within the code/a cell in the notebook. In general, these resources have been vital to understanding quantum information science for me:

- [IBM Quantum Learning resources](https://github.com/zjamesm/QuantumAlgosLearning.git)

- Quantum Information and Computation by Nielsen and Chuang

- [This online text](https://qubit.guide/)

For a good introduction I highly recommend [this](https://quantum.country/qcvc) article which integrates some unique and powerful techniques for learning!
